What I am trying to do is figure out where the highest volume of a product would be my variables are: 1. date 2. area of operations 3. condition (of the area which I have rated 1 being smooth condition to 7 roughest condition 4. direction of wind 5. the current of sea 6. temperature (which we can omit) 7. volume of product obtained   
1:10 PM
 8. moon phase (which can also be omitted or added later on as much of the data is incomplete but can easily be found online based on the dates)   
1:11 PM
 the machine learning/AI program I wanted to create is to show as accurately as possible where the area in a date that has been inpure would have the most volume   
1:12 PM
 is this something you can do? 
1:12 PM
 so based on those variables, the machine learning python based program where the highest volume would be based on the given data for the area 
 
 
 based on the date lets say hypothetically if I input the date April 5, 2021 it would tell me where highest probability of higher volume would be  
 
 
 my data consisting of those variables equates to 4582 rows per year  
1:40 PM
 I have around 30,000 rows of data 
1:40 PM
 on hand now I have 7 years I am still encoding the 8th year that would help also 
 
 
 I tried to get 10 years but was unable to procure those 
1:42 PM
 when can you start on this 
 
 1. Date is when operation was conducted  
1:51 PM
 2. area= code names of area  of operations conducted  
 
 3. volume = amount of material obtained at that point in time  
1:52 PM
 4. condition = conditions of sea at that given time (1= smooth, 2 smooth to slight 3 = slight, 4 = slight to moderate, 5 = moderate, 6, = moderate to rough 7 = rough 
1:55 PM
 5. direction of wind = what direction of wind was at the time of operations NE for north east, SW for South west, stationary wind for no wind at all) 
1:56 PM
 6. temperature = temperature of water  (but since data set is lacking we can omit) 
1:57 PM
 7. moon phase = phase of moon at time of operation  
 
 8, Current = direction of current (wsw= west south west, se- south east, nw = northwest, T = stationary or still)

 Hi Sajid, just some clarifications. Since we are dealing with nature and movements of water things will be varied. For wind direction Stationary means still no movement of win but stationary / varied direction (cloudy) means that the wind at that period could change and become strong with no fixed direction and could affect current as well 
 ==============================================================================================
 also on the newer data, the 2020 and 2021 newer equipment was used so we were able to use a current indicator. For example the current for 2020-202 instead of NW, NE, would be displayed as: .4WSW/0.2NW/0.3W this is due to the technology being utilized which shows currents at different depths we measure them in three categories: 1. Top (25 meters) 2. Middle (35055 meters) 3. Bottom (40-70 meters)  so (top current /middle current /bottom current) 
11:04 AM
 the depth itself varies as the sea floor changes and current indicator could detect up to 2000meters which is not practical for our use just some additional information. 
11:05 AM
 I am still currently verifying the information again
